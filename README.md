# 👋 Hi, I’m Valentín (aka “Valencinn”)

**`Aspiring Dev — Always Learning · Always Building`**

I enjoy turning ideas into real, working projects and experimenting with both design and code. I’m currently expanding into backend development while continuing to improve my frontend and creative coding skills. I like building, breaking, fixing, and learning new technologies as I go.
